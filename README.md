# Human Pose Estimation

### For this project, I have used Intel OpenVino library. It uses a pre-trained model to estimate the position of humans.

### For running this project you need to first install openvino runtime. The instructions for the same can be found <a href = "https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/wiki/Conda"> here.</a>
### Once you have installed openvino library, follow the following instructions

#### Step 1: `git clone https://github.com/yushendye/Human-Pose-Estimation.git`
#### Step 2: `cd Human-Pose-Estimation`
#### Step 3: `python pose_estimation.py`

### To further experiment with different models, you can change the XML file at line 86!!

### Thank you for readin!!!
